# Connector support in Angular Diagram

Connectors are objects used to create link between two points, nodes or ports to represent the relationships between them.

![Angular Diagram Connector](Connector_images/Connector_img1.png)

## Create Connector

Connector can be created by defining the start and end points. The path to be drawn can be defined with a collection of segments.
To explore the properties of a `connector`, refer to [Connector Properties](/api/js/ejDiagram#members:connectors "Connector Properties").

### Add connectors through connectors collection

The `sourcePoint` and `targetPoint` properties of connector allow you to define the end points of a `connector`. The following code example illustrates how to add a connector through connector collection.

{% highlight javascript %}

<div>
    <ej-diagram id="diagramCore" width="100%" height="490px" [connectors]="connectors">
    </ej-diagram>
</div>

{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight javascript %}

export class ModelComponent {
    connectors: Array<any>;
    constructor() {
        this.connectors = [{
            //Name of the connector
            name: "connector",
            //Sets source and target points
            sourcePoint: {
                x: 100,
                y: 100
                },
            targetPoint: {
                x: 200,
                y: 200
                }
            }];
        }
    };

{% endhighlight %}

### Add connector at run time

Connectors can be added at runtime with the client side method, `add`. The following code example illustrates how to add connector at runtime.

{% highlight javascript %}

// Defines JSON
var connector = {
    name: "connector",
    sourcePoint: {
        x: 100,
        y: 100
    },
    targetPoint: {
        x: 200,
        y: 200
    }
};
var diagram = $("#DiagramContent").ejDiagram("instance");
// Adds to the Diagram
diagram.add(connector);

{% endhighlight %}

![Angular Diagram Add connector at run time](Connector_images/Connector_img3.png)

### Connectors from palette

Connectors can be predefined and added to the symbol palette. You can drop those connectors into the Diagram, when required.

For more information about adding connectors from symbol palette, refer to [Symbol Palette](/angular/Diagram/Symbol-Palette "Symbol Palette").

### Connectors through data source

Connectors are automatically generated based on the relationships defined through the data source.
The default properties for these connectors are fetched from default settings.

For more information about data source, refer to [Data Binding](/angular/Diagram/Data-Binding "Data Binding").

### Draw connectors

Connectors can be interactively drawn by clicking and dragging on the Diagram surface by using **DrawingTool**. For more information about drawing connectors, refer to [Draw Connectors](/angular/Diagram/Tools#drawing-tools:connectors "Draw Connectors").

## Update Connector at runtime

The client side method, `updateConnector` is used to update the connectors at run time. The following code example illustrates how to update a connector at runtime.

{% highlight javascript %}

var diagram = $("#DiagramContent").ejDiagram("instance");
diagram.updateConnector("connectorName", {
    lineColor: "#1BA0E2",
    lineWidth: 5,
    lineDashArray: "5,5"
});

{% endhighlight %}

## Connect nodes

The `SourceNode` and `targetNode` properties allow to define the nodes to be connected. The following code example illustrates how to connect two nodes.

{% highlight html %}

<div>
    <ej-diagram id="diagramCore" e-height="500px" e-width="700px" e-nodes="nodes" e-defaultsettings="defaultSettings" e-connectors="connectors">
    </ej-diagram>
</div>

{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight javascript %}

export class ConnectorComponent {
    nodes: Array<any>;
    connectors: Array<any>;
    defaultSettings: Object;
    constructor() {
        this.nodes = [
            {
                name: "task1",
                offsetX: 200,
                offsetY: 200,
                labels: [{
                    text: "Task 1"
                }]
            },
            {
                name: "task2",
                offsetX: 400,
                offsetY: 200,
                labels: [{
                    text: "Task 2"
                }]
            }
        ];
        this.connectors = [
            {
                //Name of the connector
                name: "flow1",
                //Name of the source and target nodes
                sourceNode: "task1",
                targetNode: "task2"
            }];
        this.defaultSettings = {
                //Defines the common values for the nodes
                node: {
                width: 100,
                height: 50,
                fillColor: "darkCyan",
                borderColor: "black",
                type: ej.datavisualization.Diagram.Shapes.Flow,
                shape: ej.datavisualization.Diagram.FlowShapes.Process,
                labels: [{
                    fontColor: "white"
                    }]
            }
        }
    }
 }

{% endhighlight %}

![Angular Diagram Connect nodes](Connector_images/Connector_img4.png)

N> By default, connections are created at the intersecting point of segments and node bounds. The connection between any specific point of source and target nodes can be achieved with connection ports.

### Connections with ports

The `sourcePort` and `targetPort` properties allow to create connections between some specific points of source/target nodes.
The following code example illustrates how to create port to port connections.


{% highlight html %}

<div>
    <ej-diagram  id="diagramCore" width="700px" height="500px" [nodes]="nodes" [connectors]="connectors"
    [defaultSettings]="defaultSettings">

</div>

{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight javascript %}

export class NodesComponent {
    nodes: Array<any>;
    connectors: Array<any>;
    constructor() {
        this.nodes = [{
            name: "task1",
            offsetX: 350,
            offsetY: 300,
            labels: [{ text: "Task 1" }] 
            }, {
            name: "task2",
            offsetX: 200,
            offsetY: 250,
            labels: [{
                text: "Task 2"
            }],
            // Adds ports to node
            ports:  [{
                name: "in",
                offset: {
                    x: 1,
                    y: 0.65
                },
                shape: "circle",
                visibility: "visible",
                fillColor: "black"
            }, {
                name: "out",
                offset: {
                    x: 1,
                    y: 0.35
                },
                shape: "circle",
                visibility: "visible",
                fillColor: "black"
            }]
            },{
            name: "task3",
            offsetX: 350,
            offsetY: 200,
            labels: [{ text: "Task 3" }]
            }];
        this.connectors = [{
            name: "flow1",
            sourceNode: "task1",
            targetNode: "task2",
            //Name of the target port defined in the target node
            targetPort: "in"
            }, {
            name: "flow2",
            sourceNode: "task2",
            targetNode: "task3",
            //Name of the source port defined in the source node
            sourcePort: "out"
            }];
            
        //Defines the properties that carry the common values
        this.defaultSettings = {
        //Defines the common values for the nodes
        node: {
            width: 100,
            height: 50,
            fillColor: "darkCyan",
            borderColor: "black",
            type: ej.datavisualization.Diagram.Shapes.Flow,
            shape: ej.datavisualization.Diagram.FlowShapes.Process,
            labels: [{
                fontColor: "white"
            }]
        }
        //Defines common values for connectors
        connector: {
            segments: [{
                type: "orthogonal"
            }]
        }
    }
}};

{% endhighlight %}

## Segments

The path of the connector is defined with a collection of segments. There are three types of segments.

### Straight

Straight segment allows to create a straight line.
To create a straight line, you should specify the `type` of the segment as "straight" and add a straight segment to `segments` collection. The following code example illustrates how to create a default straight segment.

{% highlight javascript %}

export class ConnectorComponent {
    connectors: Array<any>;
    constructor() {
        this.connectors = [
            {
                name: "connector",
                sourcePoint: {
                    x: 100,
                    y: 100
                },
                targetPoint: {
                    x: 200,
                    y: 200
                },

                //Defines segment collection
                segments: [{
                    //When there is no previous segment, line starts from source point
                    //When the end point is not specified, line ends at target point
                    //Defines the type of the segment
                    type: "straight"
                }]
            }];
    }
}

{% endhighlight %}

![Angular Diagram Straight](Connector_images/connector_img6.png)

The `point` property of straight segment allows you to define the end point of it. The following code example illustrates how to define the end point of a straight segment.

{% highlight javascript %}

export class ConnectorComponent {
    connectors: Array<any>;
    constructor() {
        this.connectors = [
            {
                name: "connector",
                sourcePoint: {
                    x: 100,
                    y: 100
                },
                targetPoint: {
                    x: 200,
                    y: 200
                },

                //Defines segment collection
                segments: [{
                    //When there is no previous segment, line starts from source point
                    //When the end point is not specified, line ends at target point
                    //Defines the type of the segment
                    type: "straight",
                    // Defines the end point of the segment
                    point: {
                        x: 100,
                        y: 200
                    }
                }]
            }];
    }
}

{% endhighlight %}

![Angular Diagram Point property](Connector_images/Connector_img7.png)

### Orthogonal

Orthogonal segments are used to create segments that are perpendicular to each other.

Set the segment `type` as "orthogonal" to create a default orthogonal segment. The following code example illustrates how to create a default orthogonal segment.

{% highlight javascript %}

export class ConnectorComponent {
    connectors: Array<any>;
    constructor() {
        this.connectors = [
            {
                name: "connector",
                sourcePoint: {
                    x: 100,
                    y: 100
                },
                targetPoint: {
                    x: 200,
                    y: 200
                },
                //Defines segment collection
                segments: [{
                    // Define the type of the segment
                    type: "orthogonal"
                }]
            }];
    }
}

{% endhighlight %}

![Angular Diagram Orthogonal](Connector_images/Connector_img8.png)

The `length` and `direction` properties allow to define the flow and length of segment. The following code example illustrates how to create customized orthogonal segments.

{% highlight javascript %}

export class ConnectorComponent {
    connectors: Array<any>;
    constructor() {
        this.connectors = [
            {
                name: "connector",
                sourcePoint: {
                    x: 100,
                    y: 100
                },
                targetPoint: {
                    x: 200,
                    y: 200
                },
                //Defines segment collection
                segments: [{
                    // Define the type of the segment
                    type: "orthogonal",
                    length: 50,
                    direction: "bottom"
                    // Additional orthogonal segments will be added from the end of the last segment to the target point
                }]
            }];
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

![Angular Diagram](Connector_images/Connector_img9.png)

#### Avoid overlapping

Orthogonal segments are automatically re-routed, in order to avoid overlapping with the source and target nodes. The following images illustrate how orthogonal segments are re-routed.

![Angular Diagram Avoid overlapping](Connector_images/Connector_img10.png)

![Angular Diagram](Connector_images/Connector_img11.png)

N> Overlapping with source and target nodes are only avoided. Other nodes are not considered as obstacles.

### Bezier

Bezier segments are used to create curve segments and the curves are configurable either with the control points or with vectors.

To create a bezier segment, the `segment.type` is set as `bezier`. The following code example illustrates how to create a default Bezier segment.

{% highlight javascript %}

export class ConnectorComponent {
    connectors: Array<any>;
    constructor() {
        this.connectors = [
            {
                name: "connector",
                sourcePoint: {
                    x: 100,
                    y: 100
                },
                targetPoint: {
                    x: 200,
                    y: 200
                },
                //Defines segment collection
                segments: [{
                    // Define the type of the segment
                    type: "bezier"
                }]
            }];
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

![Angular Diagram Bezier](Connector_images/Connector_img12.png)

The `point1` and `point2` properties of bezier segment enable you to set the control points. The following code example illustrates how to configure the Bezier segments with control points.

{% highlight javascript %}

export class ConnectorComponent {
    connectors: Array<any>;
    constructor() {
        this.connectors = [
            {
                name: "connector",
                sourcePoint: {
                    x: 100,
                    y: 100
                },
                targetPoint: {
                    x: 200,
                    y: 200
                },
                //Defines segment collection
                segments: [{
                // Defines the type of the segment
                type: "bezier",
                // First control point: an absolute position from the page origin
                point1: {
                    x: 125,
                    y: 75
                },
                // Second control point: an absolute position from the page origin
                point2: {
                    x: 225,
                    y: 75
                }
            }]
        }];
    }
}

{% endhighlight %}

![Angular Diagram](Connector_images/Connector_img13.png)


The `vactor1` and `vector2` properties of bezier segment enable you to define the vectors. The following code illustrates how to configure a bezier curve with vectors.

{% highlight javascript %}

export class ConnectorComponent {
    connectors: Array<any>;
    constructor() {
        this.connectors = [
            {
                name: "connector",
                sourcePoint: {
                    x: 100,
                    y: 100
                },
                targetPoint: {
                    x: 200,
                    y: 200
                },
                //Defines segment collection
                segments: [{
                // Defines the type of the segment
                type: "bezier",
                // Length and angle between the source point and the first control point
                vector1: {
                    angle: 270,
                    distance: 75
                },
                // Length and angle between the target point and the second control point
                vector2: {
                    angle: 270,
                    distance: 75
                }
            }]
        }];
    }
}

{% endhighlight %}

### Complex segments

Multiple segments can be defined one after another. To create a connector with multiple segments, define and add the segments to `connector.segments` collection. The Following code example illustrates how to create a connector with multiple segments.

{% highlight javascript %}

export class ConnectorComponent {
    connectors: Array<any>;
    constructor() {
        this.connectors = [
            {
                name: "connector",
                sourcePoint: {
                    x: 100,
                    y: 100
                },
                targetPoint: {
                    x: 200,
                    y: 200
                },
                //Defines segment collection
                segments: [{
                    // Segment of length 100px to the bottom
                    type: "orthogonal",
                    length: 150,
                    direction: "bottom"
                }, {
                    //Defines a segment of 150px length to the right
                    type: "orthogonal",
                    direction: "right",
                    length: 150
                }
                //Additional orthogonal segments will be added from the end of the last segment to the target point
                ]
        }];
    }
}

## Decorator

Start and end points of a connector can be decorated with some customizable shapes like arrows, circles, diamond or path. You can decorate the connection end points with the `sourceDecorator` and `targetDecorator` properties of connector.
To explore the properties of decorators, refer to [Decorator Properties](/api/js/ejDiagram#members:connectors-sourcedecorator "Decorator Properties").

The `shape` property of decorator allows to define the shape of the decorators. The following code example illustrates how to create decorators of various shapes.

{% highlight javascript %}

export class ConnectorComponent {
    connectors: Array<any>;
    constructor() {
        this.connectors = [
            {
                name: "connector",
                sourcePoint: {
                    x: 100,
                    y: 100
                },
                targetPoint: {
                    x: 200,
                    y: 200
                },
                // Decorator shape- circle

                    x: 300,
                    y: 100
                },
                targetPoint: {
                    x: 400,

## Padding

Padding is used to leave space between the Connector's end point and the object to where it is connected.

The `sourcePadding` and `targetPadding` properties of connector define the space to be left between the connection end points and the source and target nodes of connector. The following code example illustrates how to leave space between the connection end points and source, target nodes.

{% highlight javascript %}

export class ConnectorComponent {
    connectors: Array<any>;
    nodes: Array<any>;
    constructor() {
        this.nodes = [{
            name: "task1",
            offsetX: 200,
            offsetY: 200,
            labels: [{
                text: "Task 1"
            }]
        },{
            name: "task2",
            offsetX: 400,
            offsetY: 200,
            labels: [{
                text: "Task 2"
            }]
        }];
        this.connectors = [
            {
                name: "connector",
                sourceNode: "task1",
                targetNode: "task2",
                // Space between source point and source object
                sourcePadding: 5,
                // Space between target point and target object
                targetPadding: 10
            }
        ];
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

![Angular Diagram Padding](Connector_images/Connector_img17.png)

The `connectorPadding` property of node defines the space to be left between the node bounds and its edges. The following code example illustrates how to leave the space between a node and its connections.

{% highlight javascript %}

export class ConnectorComponent {
    connectors: Array<any>;
    nodes: Array<any>;
    constructor() {
        this.nodes = [{

            offsetY: 200,
            labels: [{
                text: "Task 1"
            }],
            //Space between the node and its edges
            connectorPadding: 5
        },{
            name: "task2",
            offsetX: 400,
            offsetY: 200,
            labels: [{
                text: "Task 2"
            }]
        }];
        this.connectors = [
            {
                name: "connector",
                sourceNode: "task1",
                targetNode: "task2",
            }
        ];
    }
}

{% endhighlight %}

![Angular Diagram](Connector_images/Connector_img18.png)

The `connectorPadding` property of port defines the space between the ports and its in/out edges. The following code example illustrates how to leave the space between ports and its connections.

{% highlight javascript %}

export class ConnectorComponent {
    connectors: Array<any>;
    nodes: Array<any>;

            offsetY: 200,
            labels: [{
                text: "Task 1"
            }],
            //Space between the node and its edges
            connectorPadding: 5
        },{
            name: "task2",
            offsetX: 400,

## Bridging

Line Bridging creates a bridge for lines to smartly cross over other lines, at points of intersection. When two line connectors meet each other, the line with the higher z-order (upper one) draws an arc over the underlying connector.
Bridging can be enabled/disabled either with the `connector.constraints` or `diagram.constraints`. The following code example illustrates how to enable line bridging.

{% highlight html %}

                sourcePoint: {
                    x: 100,
                    y: 100
                },
                targetPoint: {
                    x: 200,
                    y: 200
                },
                constraints: ej.datavisualization.Diagram.ConnectorConstraints.Default
                // Removes inherit bridging or else bridging is enabled/disabled based on the Diagram constraints
                &
                ~ej.datavisualization.Diagram.ConnectorConstraints.InheritBridging
                //Includes bridging

                ej.datavisualization.Diagram.ConnectorConstraints.Bridging
        };
        this.constraints: ej.datavisualization.Diagram.DiagramConstraints.Default |
                ej.datavisualization.Diagram.DiagramConstraints.Bridging
            }
}

{% endhighlight %}

![Angular Diagram Bridging](Connector_images/Connector_img20.png)

The direction of the bridge can be customized with the property `bridgeDirection`. BridgeDirection defines the intersecting segment where the bridge has to be inserted. By default, the bridge direction points to the top.

To explore the bridge directions, refer to [Bridge Directions](/api/js/global#bridgedirection "Bridge Directions").

The following code example illustrates how to draw the bridge at the bottom direction.

{% highlight javascript %}

export class ConnectorComponent {
    connectors: Array<any>;

                targetPoint: {
                    x: 200,
                    y: 200
                },
